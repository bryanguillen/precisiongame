# Precision Shooter Game

Precision Shooter was just an idea that came up after writing up the blog program. I wanted to create something a little bit more fun 
and a bit more tricky with pure javascript, rather than another CRUD application. Enter precision, the most simplest game on 
the planet, shoot the colored dots and get rid of all those dots before you run out of lives. With this project, learning pure javascript 
and increasing skill in data manipulation were the goals in mind.

Please do not judge on graphics. =) I am terrible at that. Also, keep in mind that this game can only be played on a desktop or laptop machine.
